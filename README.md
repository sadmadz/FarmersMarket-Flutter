# Final Project
Welcome to the client side code for my final project for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. This project is a platform that helps farmers to easily showcase and sell their produce. Utilizing the power of Flutter, this app provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to upload and manage their products, as well as for customers to browse and purchase produce. With this project, I hope to support local farmers and make it easier for people to access fresh, locally sourced food.
